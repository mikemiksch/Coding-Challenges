//Description:
//
//A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B, ... Z. Each book has a code c of 3, 4, 5 or more capitals letters. The 1st letter of a code is the capital letter of the book category. In the bookseller's stocklist each code c is followed by a space and by a positive integer n (int n >= 0) which indicates the quantity of books of this code in stock.
//
//In a given stocklist all codes have the same length and all numbers have their own same length (can be different from the code length).
//
//For example an extract of one of the stocklists could be:
//
//L = {"ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"}.
//or
//
//L = ["ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"].
//In this stocklist all codes have a length of five and all numbers have a length of two.
//
//You will be given a stocklist (e.g. : L) and a list of categories in capital letters e.g :
//
//M = {"A", "B", "C", "W"}
//or
//
//M = ["A", "B", "C", "W"]
//and your task is to find all the books of L with codes belonging to each category of M and to sum their quantity according to each category.
//
//For the lists L and M of example you have to return the string (in Haskell/Clojure a list of pairs):
//
//(A : 20) - (B : 114) - (C : 50) - (W : 0)
//where A, B, C, W are the categories, 20 is the sum of the unique book of category A, 114 the sum corresponding to "BKWRK" and "BTSQZ", 50 corresponding to "CDXEF" and 0 to category 'W' since there are no code beginning with W.
//
//If L or M are empty return string is "" (Clojure should return an empty array instead).
