## Properties of Data Structures ##

**We perform the following sequence of actions:  
 1. Insert the following elements into a set: *1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 7.*  
2. Convert the set into a list and sort it in ascending order.**  
 
**Select the option below that denotes the sorted list:**  

* {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
* {9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
* {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
* None of the above.

## Lookup operations ##

**There are several factors that affect the efficiency of lookup operations in a hash table.  
Which of the following is NOT one of those factors?  
Pick one of the choices:**  

* Number of elements stored in the hash table 
* Size of elements stored in the hash table 
* Number of buckets in the hash table
* Quality of the hash function
