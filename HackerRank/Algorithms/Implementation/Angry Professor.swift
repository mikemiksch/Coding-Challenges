//A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of N students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than K students are present when class starts.
//
//Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.
//
//Input Format
//
//The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.
//
//Each test case consists of two lines. The first line has two space-separated integers,  N (students in the class) and K (the cancelation threshold). The second line contains  N space-separated integers (a1, a2, ..., aN) describing the arrival times for each student.
//    
//Note: Non-positive arrival times (ai <= 0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times (ai >= 0) indicate the student arrived ai minutes late.
//
//Constraints
//
// * 1 <= T <= 10
// * 1 <= N <= 1000
// * 1 <= K <= N
// * -100 <= ai <= 100 where i âˆˆ[1,N]
//
//Output Format
//
//For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not.
//
//Note
//If a student arrives exactly on time (ai = 0), the student is considered to have entered before the class started.
//
//Sample Input
//
// 2
// 4 3
// -1 -3 4 2
// 4 2
// 0 -1 2 1
//
//Sample Output
//
// YES
// NO
//
//Explanation
//
//For the first test case, K = 3. The professor wants at least 3 students in attendance, but only 2 have arrived on time (-3 and -1). Thus, the class is canceled.
//
//For the second test case, K = 2 . The professor wants at least 2 students in attendance, and there are  who have arrived on time (0 and -1). Thus, the class is not canceled.

// We could handle this in a single line of "return times.filter { $0 <= 0 }.count >= k? "NO" : "YES" but I prefer to assign the filtered count to its own variable for readibility purposes.

// We could evaluate it with the reverse criteria, by filtering for $0 > 0 and seeing if the count is < k
