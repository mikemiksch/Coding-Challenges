//A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given p integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is Prime or Not prime on a new line.
//
//Note: If possible, try to come up with an O(sqrt n) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you can come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!
//
//Input Format
//
//The first line contains an integer, p, denoting the number of integers to check for primality.
//    Each of the p subsequent lines contains an integer, n, you must test for primality.
//        
// Constraints
//
// * 1 <= p <= 30
// * 1 <= n <= 2 x 10^2
//        
//Output Format
//
//For each integer, print whether n is Prime or Not prime on a new line.
//
//Sample Input
//
// 3
// 12
// 5
// 7
//
//Sample Output
//
// Not prime
// Prime
// Prime
//
//Explanation
//
//We check the following p = 3 integers for primality:
//
//is divisible by numbers other than  and itself (i.e.: , , ), so we print Not prime on a new line.
//is only divisible  and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
//is only divisible  and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.

//        result = !(2...topRange).contains { n % $0 == 0 }

// This solution is "Best" per the editorial on HackerRank, reutnring a solution after 11584 checks, half as much. This is accomplished by only comparing n to odd numbers in the range, since any even number greater than 2 is divisible by 2 and therefore not prime.
